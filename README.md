# SyncLearn

A full-stack MERN educational platform with role-based access for **Admins**, **Teachers**, and **Students**.

## Security Notes

- JWT tokens expire in **1 hour**
- `password` field uses `select: false` — never returned in any query
- `correctAns` stripped server-side before sending quiz to students
- Teacher ownership enforced at the **service layer**
- `localStorage.clear()` + redirect on any 401 response

## Default Test Accounts

After running the seed script (`node Server/seed.js`) — or enrolling via the admin panel:

| Role | Portal | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | `localhost:5174` | `admin@test.com` | `password123` |
| Teacher | `localhost:5174` | `teacher@test.com` | `password123` |
| Student | `localhost:5173` | `student@test.com` | `password123` |

> Seed script: `node Server/seed.js`
